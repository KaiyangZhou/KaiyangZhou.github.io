<p>
Dr. Kaiyang Zhou is currently a research fellow at NTU Singapore, working with Prof. <a href="https://liuziwei7.github.io/">Ziwei Liu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/">Chen Change Loy</a>. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Surrey, UK, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html">Tao Xiang</a>. His research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, with specialization in representation learning, domain generalization and data-efficient learning. He has published more than 20 papers at top-tier journals and conferences in relevant fields with over 3,000 citations received (h-index: 15). He is a guest editor of International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) and has served as an area chair and senior program committee member for BMVC 2022 and AAAI 2023, respectively. He is the creator of the popular open-source software <a href="https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid">Torchreid</a> for person re-identification.

<p><i>*Will join the <a href="https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/">Dept. of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University</a> as Assistant Professor in August 2023. Several fully-funded PhD studentships in AI/CV/ML are available (starting in Fall 2024). Feel free to get in touch. (Please read <a href="recruit.html">this</a> before sending an email.)</i></p>
