<h3> To prospective students </h3>

<p>
Thanks very much for your interest in joining Dr. Zhou's group. If you would like to apply for a PhD position (starting in Spring/Fall 2024), please email Dr. Zhou with the following documents:
<ul>
    <li> <i>The latest CV</i>, which should contain the following information: current position, education, research experience/projects, work experience, publications, awards and honors, coding skills, referee(s), etc. Please indicate who the supervisor(s) is in relevant places, e.g., education and research experience/projects. </li>
    <li> <i>A cover letter</i>, which should explain, for example, your motivation and relevant experiences/achievements that make you an ideal PhD candidate. The cover letter is not required if you put everything in the email. But it is strongly advised to have a cover letter (which serves as a writing sample), in which case the email can be very brief. (Do not use ChatGPT to polish the writing because Dr. Zhou has been well trained to distinguish between human and machine-generated texts.) </li>
    <li> <i>Most representative paper/technical report</i> (if applicable). </li>
</ul>
