<h3> To prospective students </h3>

<p>Thanks very much for your interest in joining Dr. Zhou's group. If you would like to apply for a PhD position (starting in Spring/Fall 2024), please email Dr. Zhou with the following documents:
<ul>
    <li> <i>The latest CV</i>, which should contain the following information (when applicable): current position, education, research experience/projects, work experience, publications, awards and honors, coding skills, referee(s), etc. (Please indicate who the supervisor(s) is in relevant places, e.g., education and research experience.) </li>
    <li> <i>A cover letter</i>, which should explain, for example, your motivation and relevant experiences/achievements that make you the ideal candidate. The cover letter is not required if you have put everything in the email. But it would be much better to have a cover letter (like a writing sample), in which case the email can be brief. </li>
    <li> <i>Most representative paper</i> (if applicable), which could be published or unpublished. </li>
</ul>
</p>
