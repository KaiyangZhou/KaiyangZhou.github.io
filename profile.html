<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
  Dr. Kaiyang Zhou is currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx">Nanyang Technological University</a>, Singapore, working with Prof. <a href="https://liuziwei7.github.io/">Ziwei Liu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/">Chen Change Loy</a>. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science (2020) from the <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/">University of Surrey</a>, UK, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html">Tao Xiang</a>. Prior to that, he received his MSc with Distinction (2016) from the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</a>, UK; BSc with 1st class honor (2015) from <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/">Ulster University</a>, UK; BEng (2015) from <a href="http://www.fjnu.edu.cn/english/">Fujian Normal University</a>, China. He has worked in <a href="https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge">Samsung AI Center Cambridge</a>, UK, as a research intern from 2018–19, and <a href="http://english.siat.cas.cn/">Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)</a>, Chinese Academy of Sciences, as a visiting student supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ&hl=en">Yu Qiao</a> from 2016–17.

<p>
  Dr. Zhou's research centers around the development of generalizable machine learning algorithms for computer vision, with particular interests in the following topics: domain generalization/adaptation, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, X-shot learning (X=zero/few), and unsupervised learning. His papers have been published at major journals and conferences in the field, including TPAMI (IF: 17.861), TIP (IF: 10.865), ICLR (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence">#1 conference in AI</a>), AAAI, and the three prominent computer vision conferences (CVPR, ICCV & ECCV). According to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gRIejugAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>, his papers have been cited more than 1,300 times, with h-index at 13 (as of June 2022). He serves as a reviewer for top-tier venues in the field including TPAMI, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and so on.

<p>
  Dr. Zhou is also an active contributor to the open-source community on <a href="https://github.com/KaiyangZhou">Github</a> and has developed several open-source projects that are widely used by the community, of both academia and industry, with over 5.9k stars received in total. Two representative projects are <a href="https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid">Torchreid</a>, for person re-identification, and <a href="https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch">Dassl.pytorch</a>, for domain generalization.
