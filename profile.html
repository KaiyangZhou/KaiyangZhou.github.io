<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
  Dr. Kaiyang Zhou is currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx">Nanyang Technological University</a>, Singapore, working with Prof. <a href="https://liuziwei7.github.io/">Ziwei Liu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/">Chen Change Loy</a>. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science (2020) from the <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/">University of Surrey</a>, UK, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html">Tao Xiang</a>. Prior to that, he received his MSc with Distinction (2016) from the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</a>, UK; BSc with 1st class honor (2015) from <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/">Ulster University</a>, UK; BEng (2015) from <a href="http://www.fjnu.edu.cn/english/">Fujian Normal University</a>, China. He has interned at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge">Samsung AI Center Cambridge</a>, UK, with Prof. <a href="http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html">Tao Xiang</a> from 2018–19, and <a href="http://english.siat.cas.cn/">Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)</a>, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ&hl=en">Yu Qiao</a> from 2016–17.

<p>
  Dr. Zhou's research lies at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. In broad terms, his research goal is to develop AI (powered by machine learning) that, once trained, can generalize the learned concepts to previously unseen domains or scenarios, in an efficient manner---e.g., using little supervision or few data. His papers have been published at major journals and conferences in relevant fields, such as TPAMI (IF: 17.86; flagship journal in AI), IJCV (IF: 11.54; flagship journal in computer vision), TIP (IF: 10.86), ICLR (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence">#1 conference in AI</a>), AAAI, and the three prominent computer vision conferences (i.e., CVPR, ICCV & ECCV). According to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gRIejugAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>, his papers have been cited more than 1,500 times, with h-index at 13 (as of Jul 2022). He serves as a reviewer for top-tier venues including TPAMI, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, etc.

<p>
  Dr. Zhou is also an active contributor to the open-source community on <a href="https://github.com/KaiyangZhou">Github</a> and has developed several open-source projects that are widely used by the community, of both academia and industry, with over 6k stars received in total. Two representative projects are <a href="https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid">Torchreid</a>, for person re-identification, and <a href="https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch">Dassl.pytorch</a>, for domain generalization.
