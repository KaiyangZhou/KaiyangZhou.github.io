<h3> To prospective students </h3>

<p><i>*Note: Only candidates that pass the initial screening will be contacted.</i></p>

<p>
Thanks very much for your interest in joining our group. If you would like to apply for a PhD position, please email Dr. Zhou with the following documents:
<ul>
    <li> <i>An up-to-date CV</i>, which should contain the following information: current position, education, research experience/projects, work experience, publications, awards and honors, coding skills, referees' contact details (at least two), etc. Please indicate who the supervisor(s) is in relevant places, e.g., education and research experience/projects. Moreover, it would be great to highlight your achievements in the CV, such as top ranks measured by GPA, awards from coding/AI competitions, and/or publications at recognized CV/ML venues. </li>
    <li> <i>A cover letter</i>, which should explain, for example, your motivation and relevant experiences/achievements that you think would make you an ideal PhD candidate in AI research. The cover letter is not required if you choose to put everything in the email. But it is strongly advised to have a cover letter (serving as a writing sample), in which case the email can be very brief. If you have zero experience in writing a cover letter, you should do some research on the web (here is a good <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/cfg/students/career-resources/cover-letter">example</a>). (Do not use ChatGPT to polish the writing because Dr. Zhou has been well trained to distinguish between human and machine-generated texts.) </li>
    <li> <i>Most representative paper/technical report</i> (if applicable), which could be a pdf or a link in the CV. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Please use the following format for the email subject: PhD application - current affiliation - current position - name, e.g., PhD application - HKBU - BSc (3rd year) - Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Please refer to HKBU CS Dept's <a href="https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/?pid=70">Admission page</a> for more details about some requirements (e.g., English language requirements) and the application procedures.</p>
